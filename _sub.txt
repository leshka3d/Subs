[man]
Get me in ten minutes, Ray.

4
00:00:51,987 --> 00:00:52,988
[Ray] Boss.

00:01:08,438 --> 00:01:10,473
Bobby.
Boss?

8
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:13,376
I'll have a pint
and a pickled egg.

9
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:15,077
Coming straight up.

10
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:18,548

["Cumberland Gap"

12
00:01:46,309 --> 00:01:48,911
[man] If you wish to be
the king of the jungle,

13
00:01:49,044 --> 00:01:51,314
it's not enough
to act like a king.

14
00:01:54,217 --> 00:01:55,818
You must be the king.

15
00:01:57,086 --> 00:01:58,754
And there can be no doubt.

16
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:03,959
Because doubt causes chaos
and one's own demise.

Hello, my love.

21
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,508
It's date night tonight.

22
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:20,843
Nine o'clock,
you and I, River Cafe.

All tell ya *

35
00:02:50,473 --> 00:02:53,409
* Sure enough
It may get tough *

00:02:53,543 --> 00:02:56,846
* If it doesn't kill ya
Kill ya *

37
00:02:57,313 --> 00:03:03,185

* Oh, the snow kept coming *

45
00:03:32,147 --> 00:03:34,750
* Picked her up
Upon his back *

46
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:38,388
* By God
He loved that woman *

00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,026
* Daniel stood

[ice rattles]

60
00:04:59,068 --> 00:05:00,370
[man] Chink, chink.

61
00:05:07,076 --> 00:05:08,077
Fletcher.

62
00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:11,681
Buenas tardes, Raymondo.
[chuckles]

63
00:05:11,814 --> 00:05:15,518
I should stab you
with that fucking
rolling pin.

64
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:19,655
Oh, don't be cunty.
I was just hoping we could have
a cozy little drink together.

65
00:05:20,122 --> 00:05:24,660
So, I've got a meeting
on Saturday
at your favorite newspaper.

66
00:05:25,761 --> 00:05:30,199
As the best
private investigator
in this smoky little town--

67
00:05:30,332 --> 00:05:32,468
good evening,
ladies and gentlemen--

68
00:05:32,602 --> 00:05:36,772
they are ready to put
150 grand in my pocket
to give them some filth.

69
00:05:36,906 --> 00:05:39,208
Good for me, that,
but in this case...

70
00:05:40,943 --> 00:05:42,144
it's bad for you.

71
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:47,282
So Big Dave,
editor extraordinaire,

72
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:51,220
has developed a terrible
antipathy for your boss

73
00:05:51,353 --> 00:05:54,056
and his liquorish assortment
of tasty mates.

74
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:59,261
He's out to destroy him and
all those that cozy up to him.
Front cover. Bosh!

75
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:01,897
There will be blood
and fucking feathers
everywhere, my darling.

76
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:05,000
Get to it, Fletcher.
I'm starting to itch.

77
00:06:05,134 --> 00:06:08,070
Now, we both know
that your boss has
very, very deep pockets,

78
00:06:08,203 --> 00:06:11,240
and I would like to
invite him just to have
a teeny rummage in them.

79
00:06:12,842 --> 00:06:14,577
What the fuck
are you talking about?

80
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,345
If you would be so kind

81
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,013
as to furnish me with
20 million British pounds,

82
00:06:18,147 --> 00:06:19,782
I will give you everything--

83
00:06:19,915 --> 00:06:23,018
memory cards, contact sheets,
recordings, the lot,

84
00:06:23,152 --> 00:06:26,589
and a modest little screenplay
I wrote all by myself.

85
00:06:26,722 --> 00:06:27,757
Hold on.

86
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:31,927
We just went from Â£150,000
to 20 million.

87
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:34,229
That's a steep rise
in 30 seconds.

88
00:06:34,363 --> 00:06:37,199
Yeah, but I would argue
that you're lucky,
because that is nothing

89
00:06:37,332 --> 00:06:41,036
compared to what I could,
and perhaps should, be asking.

90
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,106
Oh, well, thank God
you're not greedy, Fletcher,

91
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:46,609
you deluded,
shit-eating cunt.

92
00:06:46,742 --> 00:06:48,410
[chuckles]

93
00:06:48,544 --> 00:06:50,580
I quite like it
when you talk dirty to me.

94
00:06:51,781 --> 00:06:53,983
I can feel myself engorging.

95
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,152
Come on, have a drink with me.
It's really yummy.

96
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,923
I looked it up. App-ed it.
1500 quid?

97
00:07:01,056 --> 00:07:03,659
I didn't know
you could spend that much
on a bottle of scotch.

98
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:09,231
I'm gonna tell you a story
to demonstrate
why my quote is my quote.

99
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,201
Will you play a game
with me, Ray?

100
00:07:13,402 --> 00:07:14,904
I don't wanna play a game.

101
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:18,407
-Please?
-No.

102
00:07:18,841 --> 00:07:20,910
I said play a fucking game
with me, Ray.

103
00:07:22,077 --> 00:07:23,613
[teapot whistling]

104
00:07:29,619 --> 00:07:30,686
Right.

105
00:07:31,153 --> 00:07:32,254
Lovely.

106
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:36,258
Now, I want you
to imagine a character,

107
00:07:36,391 --> 00:07:39,662
a dramatic character,
like in a book or a play
or a film.

108
00:07:39,795 --> 00:07:42,397
But not digital,
not on a memory stick.

109
00:07:42,532 --> 00:07:45,968
Analog. Chemical process.
"Keep the grain
in the picture," I say.

110
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:47,603
Old-school, 35 mill.

111
00:07:47,737 --> 00:07:50,272
[whirring]

112
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,309
Now, I'm seeing this
through a lens, I am,

113
00:07:54,443 --> 00:07:56,211
and I'm not talking about
the small screen.

114
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:57,947
It's not TV, Raymond.

115
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,950
As I said,
old-school cinema format.

116
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:04,887
It's what we in the business
called anamorphic,
or ratio 2.35 to 1.

117
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,790
And I want you to join me
on this cinematic journey,

118
00:08:07,923 --> 00:08:09,692
'cause it is cinema, Ray.

119
00:08:09,825 --> 00:08:12,795
It's beautiful,
beautiful cinema.

120
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:16,265
Now, roll camera.

121
00:08:16,398 --> 00:08:18,167
[whirring]

122
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:20,803
Enter our protagonist.

123
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:23,105
He's good-looking,
he's gorgeous,

124
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:26,508
he's golden age,
he's a proper handsome cunt.

125
00:08:26,642 --> 00:08:30,145
His name is Mickey Pearson.

126
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,815
Unique background
has our Mickey.

127
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:37,687
American born, Rhodes scholar,
so he's born clever but poor.

128
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,489
Now, that's quite a leap from
a trailer park in Americana

129
00:08:40,623 --> 00:08:43,525
to the thousand-year-old
university in old Angleterre,

130
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:47,029
where he studies
the dark art of horticulture.

131
00:08:47,162 --> 00:08:50,232
But he never
finished his education,
never went home, because...

132
00:08:50,365 --> 00:08:52,534
he found his vocation.

133
00:08:52,668 --> 00:08:53,969
A naughty vocation.

134
00:08:54,804 --> 00:08:56,338
He's a bad boy.

135
00:08:56,471 --> 00:08:59,074
He starts dealing
the dirty wonder weed

136
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,377
to his rich, British,
upper-class uni pals

137
00:09:02,511 --> 00:09:04,847
and realizes
he's rather good at it.

138
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,750
He's clear and objective
about ambition

139
00:09:07,883 --> 00:09:11,386
and he can surf the echelons
of our complicated culture.

140
00:09:12,822 --> 00:09:16,258
He knew how to take advantage
of his advantage.

141
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,929
He was a hungry animal,
you see.

142
00:09:20,062 --> 00:09:23,065
He was powerful and ruthless,
cunning and quick,

143
00:09:23,198 --> 00:09:25,567
charismatic and smart, but...

144
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:28,437
he had to do some naughty
things to get where he got,

145
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,205
to establish his position,

146
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:32,975
to show he wasn't just
teeth, tits and tan.
